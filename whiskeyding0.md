## Redeems
Whiskey's channel makes heavy use of channel points (called cheddar) and redeems. His 3D model responds to many of his redeems including:
- Throw bananas at Whiskey (100pts)
- annoy whiskey with confetti (100pts)
- Tornado, which whiskey runs away from before getting sucked into it, spun around, and thrown violently against the screen (1000pts)
- "SOAP" this redeem will challenge whiskey to go for 5 minutes without uttering a curse word. If he fails the soap challenge, he has to gift a tier 1 gift subscription to a random viewer of the channel.

Chat is often encouraged to "gamba" their cheddar on predictions, often betting if Whiskey will pass/fail at a level of the game he's currently playing.
