# CurlyKody
Streamer uses a husky 3D Model instead of a webcam and goes by **Kody**.
Streamer often makes jokes that are more crude/gross and acts in a cringy manner to be entertaining. This makes him oddly endearing

## Notable Games
- Morrowind
- Cyberpunk 2077

## Mods
- Zaiden_9
- Johann262
- Marcothedingo
- Pinkithachristie

## Redeems
Kody makes extensive use of channel points (called Milkbones)
- "Potion of Restore Urine"(100pts) This makes Kody take a drink of water, which he often does audibly
- Sounds: GORP (100pts) plays a gorp sound on the stream with an overlay
- Sounds: BONK (100pts) a bonk sound is played and a 3D Bat hits Kody's 3D Model
  - If several of these are redeemed in a row, it will make Kody's 3D model ragdoll and his legs flail into the air. Chat loves to see this pointing out his toebeans.
- Fart Sounds. Each of these plays a fart sound over the stream's audio.
  - Blastinator(250pts)
  - Echo!(300pts)
  - The Ripper(300pts)

## In-Jokes
