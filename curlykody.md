- Streamer uses a husky 3D Model with a bandana on his neck, instead of a traditional webcam
- goes by *Kody/Kodykins*.
- Streamer often uses toilet humor and acts in a cringy manner to be entertaining.

  - *"Welcome to the curly crew! You are now a member of the Curly Crew!"*
- Timezone: Atlantic Time (UTC-4)
## Notable Games
- Morrowind
- Cyberpunk 2077
  - His terrible driving in his tiny car nicknamed "The Dorrito" is nefarious

## Mods
- Zaiden_9
- Johann262
- Marcothedingo

## Redeems
Kody makes extensive use of channel points (called Milkbones)
- "Potion of Restore Urine"(100pts) This makes Kody take a drink of water, which he often does audibly
  - Further refinement was added incorporating animated water raining down on him before a bucket lands on his head.
- Sounds: GORP (100pts) plays a gorp sound on the stream with an overlay
- Sounds: BONK (100pts) a bonk sound is played and a 3D Bat hits Kody's 3D Model
  - If several of these are redeemed in a row (around 10), it will make Kody's 3D model ragdoll and his legs flail into the air. Chat loves to see this pointing out his toebeans.
- Fart Sounds. Each of these plays a fart sound over the stream's audio.
  - Blastinator(250pts)
  - Echo!(300pts)
  - The Ripper(300pts)

## In-Jokes
- Chat will often refer to Kody as being a bottom, since he has a very easygoing personality.
  - Kody will often protest and slam his desk which is audible over the stream.
  - The fact Kody often exclaims "Fuck My Ass!" when something bad happens doesn't help his case.
  - Same with him making "bottom fingers" anytime someone donates or does something nice.
### Unique vocabulary
- Kody's made up vocabulary is quite extensive...
  - Kody often refers to cursed things as being a "creech" which is sort for a creature
  - For unknown reasons he makes riffs on "Agitha Christie"'s name. (e.g. SOMETHING-itha Christie)
