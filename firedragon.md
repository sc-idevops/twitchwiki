A human streamer who's mascott is an adorable cartoony red dragon. He is known as "fifi" by his loving community, which he is highly interactive with. Fifi promotes a positive friendly atmosphere and his chat and community is very wholesome. 

- Fifi has been streaming since 2013 and is known for his speedrun streams, many of which are Nintendo games.
- Is an offical Twitch Partner! (year obtained unknown)
- Timezone: Central Time (UTC-6)
- Attended TwitchCon 2019

## Nickname Fifi
Back when he was a smaller streamer circa 2015 there was a community concensus that saying "firedragon" was just too long. After some debate a chat member named "realitem" created the nickname "fifi" which is pronounced like the Fi in Wi-Fi and not like a nickname for a dog. It stuck and as new members joined they picked up the nickname and it lives on!
